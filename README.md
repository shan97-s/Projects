Description: An application is made which includes playing battleship game, in which ships are destroyed using cannon balls, the game has dashboard with screen and buttons.


link for the game: http://127.0.0.1:5502/


varibales are declared based on the storing no. of cannonballs, usr score, accesssibility, no. of ships etc.
Only one div element is created in HTML, rest of  the code is generated through JS.
Nested for loops are used which played main role for the creation of the game structure. Several if else statements. The whole game is fully responsive.

There was a lack of time, I would have created the feature of playing game with computer.
